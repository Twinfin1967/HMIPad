\
Thank you for reviewing this app. I'm answering each point below.\
\
2.7 \
\
The app does not download or is able to download code. \
\
The app includes iTunes File Sharing and an embedded web server, but they are just used to load and open documents in the app (we call it projects). This is similar to our ScadaMobile and Modbus Gem apps, and also equivalent to virtually all document based apps such as Numbers or Keynote. Documents that this app is able to open do not contain executable code.\
\
We forgot to add the UIFileSharingEnabled key to the info.plist file. This has been corrected.\
\
The URL Scheme is used to confirm new accounts. Account creation is initiated from the app but our server sends a confirmation email that requires account confirmation. The received email contains an url that opens the app and causes the app to talk with the server to confirm account activation. The same mechanism is used for requesting password resets.\
\
2.16.\
\
The app can indeed play audio in the background. The app is able to play audio files in the "HMiPad" Playlist of the iPod library.\
We prepared a project file demonstrating this. First you must create a playlist named "HMiPad" on the Music app and put some songs there. \
Then do the following:\
- Login to the demo account\
	user: TestUser\
	password: energy\
-  On the Integrators Service section go to "Projects". You should see a project named "PlayMusic"\
-  Download the project named "PlayMusic"\
- The downloaded project will appear in "Other Projects" under the Local Files section\
- Open the PlayMusic project. Replace "Animal Instinct" by the song name you placed on the "HMiPad" playlist.\
- You will be able to play and stop this song from the app and it may continue playing in the background.\
\
8.1\
\
I propose to rename the app from "HMiPad" to "HMI Pad". HMI stands for 'Human Machine Interface', this is a common acronym used in the manufacturing industry.\
\
 --\
\
I am updating the demo account fields in iTunes connect with the appropriate entries. Particularly\
	user: TestUser\
	password: energy\
\
--\
\
To reach the In-App purchase in the app do the following:\
- Login with the demo account\
- Tap on "Other Projects" and open a project, for example the "StarterProject".\
- Navigate again to the main view on the left pane and tap on "Current Project"\
- Tap on "Activate..."\
- Tap on "Upload Project"\
- The store should appear at this time.\
\
--\
\
I hope you reconsider the app for approval. I am at your disposal for any questions or comments that may arise regarding the reviewing process of this app.\
\
Thanks\

Hello,\
\
Thank you for reviewing this app.\
\
I propose to change the app name to HMI View. I changed all mentions of the former name to the new one in the app.\
\
The app can play audio in the background. The app is able to play audio files in the "HMiPad" Playlist of the iPod library.\
First you must create a playlist named "HMiPad" on the Music app and put some songs there. \
To make it easier for you to test we prepared a project file demonstrating this. You can download said project with the following code: 0xh6gez8ND2R\
by following the steps described on the Review Notes section (but using this code instead). A project named "PlayMusic" should download.\
Open the PlayMusic project. Replace "Animal Instinct" by the song name you placed on the "HMiPad" playlist.\
You will be able to play and stop this song from the app and it may continue playing in the background.\
\
Please let me know in case you found any other issues.  I am at your disposal for any questions or comments that may arise regarding the reviewing process of this app.\
\
Thanks.\

\cf0 The app is intended to create HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces) for PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) based systems. "Integrator" users create such interfaces for later deployment on "End Users" devices. User interfaces created by Integrators are called Projects. Integrators are small companies or individuals who are able to install PLC based systems. \
\
This app works with the HMI View app that we submitted at the same time for review. With the HMI Pad app integrators can create iPad based HMIs for their customers (End Users). To do so integrators buy "Activation Codes" and upload Projects to our server using the HMI Pad app. Activation codes remain linked to particular projects through our server. "Codes" can then be used on the HMI View app for downloading associated projects and visualize them on the HMI View app.\

\
\
Thank you for reviewing this app.\
\
I note that the app has been rejected for the same reasons It was rejected before. I replied before by explaining why the app is in conformance with the Guidelines or proposing changes on the other cases.\
\
2.16.\
\
The app can indeed play audio in the background. I explained how to do so. This is exactly the same as our ScadaMobile app which has been in the store for 3 years. These are the steps to reproduce audio in the background:\
\
The app is able to play audio files in the "HMiPad" Playlist of the iPod library.\uc0\u8232 We prepared a project file demonstrating this. First you must create a playlist named "HMiPad" on the Music app and put some songs there. \u8232 Then do the following:\u8232 \
- Login to the demo account\
\uc0\u8232 user: TestUser\
\uc0\u8232 password: energy\u8232 \
- On the Integrators Service section go to "Projects". You should see a project named "PlayMusic"\
\uc0\u8232 - Enter Edit Mode, tap on the action menu and Download the project named "PlayMusic"\
\uc0\u8232 - The downloaded project will appear in "Other Projects" under the Local Files section\
\uc0\u8232 - Open the PlayMusic project. Replace "Animal Instinct" by the song name you placed on the "HMiPad" playlist.\u8232 - You will be able to play and stop this song from the app and it may continue playing in the background. \
\
Please clarify why this is not compliant with the 'audio' background mode. \
\
2.7\
\
The app does not download code. I do not understand why you claim so or what brings you to conclude this is (or could be) the case. \
\
This is just a Document based app just like many others. Document based apps are supposed to be allowed to download documents. Examples of Document based apps are 'Numbers', 'Keynote' and 'Documents to Go' among many others. Documents in the HMI Pad app can be edited within the app and stored into external storage. I do not see why this is related to 'code'. Our ScadaMobile app can not even edit documents from within the app (only download them) and was never considered to break this guideline, so downloading documents should be definitely possible.\
\
I strongly believe this app is totally compliant with this guideline so I would appreciate that you clarify why you think it is not, so I can focus my answer on your particular concern.\
\
8.1\
\
Since there are hundreds of apps on the App Store that use the word 'Pad' in its name, I assume this rejection is because of the nearby 'I' of the HMI acronym that may sound like "iPad" next to the 'Pad' word when pronouncing both words together in English. Please confirm that this is the case and I can still use the word 'Pad' in other ways. At this point I can think of "HMI Draw Pad" or something to that effect, please confirm that this would suit. Thanks\

I would appreciate that you add this (quoted below) as further information to the resolution center for this app. Thanks.\
\
"\
I uploaded a new binary which removes several Exported Type UTIs and Document types that we found to be incorrect (and non functional) for this version of the app. Also, according to review requirements I also renamed the app and all occurrences of it from "HMI Pad" to "HMI Draw".\
"\

==== JOAN ====\
\
Dear Sirs,\
\
The app "HMI Draw" has been rejected for non compliance with guideline 2.7: "apps that download code in any way or form will be rejected". \
\
I believe the functionality or implementation of the app has been misunderstood.\
\
To my understanding, guideline 2.7 is intended to prevent apps from behaving in a way or performing actions that would escape your ability to fully test and review them, by for example downloading code. I understand this could include replacement of app user interface, emulating other uncontrolled platforms, even becoming a completely different app, or related things. \
\
The HMI Draw app does not download or run any kind of external code, and it does not even break the above interpretation of the guideline. The HMI Draw app is just a document based app, documents are created and edited in the app and can be stored in external places using available options such as iTunes File Sharing. Documents are just a plain representation of the app object model. This is in no way different than the hundreds of document based apps of any kind available on the app store, including Numbers, Keynote, Pages and many others from third parties.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 The HMI Draw app is similar to Keynote or Pages in the sense that it allows users to place objects on pages such as images or other visual elements such as several kinds of indicators and controls like bars, trends, sliders and so on. The app also has the ability to communicate with industrial devices called PLCs and to get discrete engineering data such as temperatures, pressures, speed and other data values that particular PLCs may manage. The app also allows visual elements on pages to be connected to PLCs to present values on a graphical manner, or to use controls placed by users on pages to write discrete data to PLCs. Users can link visual elements in pages with PLC values by using mathematical relationships in a similar way than they would link cells on a spreadsheet program. The purpose of the app is therefore to create dynamic real time graphical representations of PLC values.\

\cf0 \
Technically, the application model of this app is a tree like graph of objects that are linked together. Documents created by this app are serialized representations of the application model. Document files are created by recursively traversing the application model and serializing it into a file. Conversely, the application model is created by performing the reverse operation on document files. Documents contain pages, items on pages, PLC connectors and the relationships among them. The app is only able to open documents of its own declared UTI type.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 The app thus does not download code or performs anything that could be related with the execution of code, nor it is able to perform any actions or behave in a way that would go beyond what you can review, an thus it will not break guideline 2.7.\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural

The target users for this app are Industrial Automation Integrators. On a previous submission the app featured an embedded web server. The purpose of it was to provide a means to import and export files from the app including its own documents -we call them 'projects' in the context of the app- and images in a way that was easy for users.\
\
I am asked now to remove iTunes File sharing from the app. But leaving no options to import and export files would greatly jeopardize the app. Automation Integrators are used to keep their 'projects' and image files organized in folders in their own PC or Mac and they tend to create document templates to use as a starting point for new projects. In other words, they expect this app to have file export and import capabilities, thus the app needs to provide ways to move documents and images to and from a PC and vice-versa, which as a said is no different than any document based app.\
\
As a side note I want to include the following points that I think will help to clarify what this app is about and the relative importance of getting it approved on the app store as it is now:\
\
We spent almost a full year at developing this app and we have dedicated a lot of efforts and money on doing so. The app as it is today creates a strong WOW effect when demonstrated to its target audience. The people to whom I have shown the app and the ones who had the opportunity to play with it really LOVE the app. They are mostly Industrial Automation professionals and they can also see the app as a real opportunity to enhance their business. We are preparing a global marketing campaign to give awareness of this app and we have high expectations.\
\
The income that this app will generate is exclusivelly based on In-App store sales from within the app, so Apple will get its share. In-app purchases in this app are significantly more expensive than average but people to whom we showed the app really WANT to buy them and they claim they would pay more if the price was higher.\
\
I understand very well Apple review policies and why they are in place, we are not amateurs or newbie developers, we've been in the business for years and our apps are very appreciated by their target audience. We are exclusively developing for the iOS platform and we are convinced Apple advocates. We have many customers switching from Android to iOS just to be able to use one of our apps. I believe this alone is significant enough to consider this app for approval on the app store. The "HMI Draw" app will be particularly powerful to boost this trend among its target audience.\
\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\pardirnatural
\cf0 Finally, I want to quote a excerpt of the App Store Review Guidelines: "Join us in trying to surprise and delight users. Show them their world in innovative ways, and let them interact with it like never before. In our experience, users really respond to polish, both in functionality and user interface. Go the extra mile. Give them more than they expect. And take them places where they have never been before. We are ready to help.". Well, you should look at the faces and hear at the comments that Industrial Automation professionals make after they have given the opportunity to play for a while with this app. I think this piece of the Guidelines describes what happens quite accurately.\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural
\cf0 \
We planned and developed the "HMI Draw" app with all the App Store Review Guidelines in mind. We of course may have misinterpreted something but I think we did not, so I wish you to reconsider rejecting this app or/and give me some suggestions to make it better to get approved without deleting its core functionality.\
\
I am available at any time to clarify anything that could be needed or to resolve any questions that could arise during the reviewing process of the app.\
\
Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this matter.\
\
Best Regards,\
\
John Lluch\

==== 21 Juliol 2013  ====\
\
Thanks for reviewing this app.\
\
I assume the problem is the presence of an entry on the CFBundleDocumentTypes, "Content Files", that would allow the app to import some particular file types through mail attachments that may be undesirable.\
\
I have removed the CFBundleDocumentTypes entry on the info.plist file for documents of type "Content Files". So now, this key only strictly includes the 'Exported Type UTI' that is 'Owned' by the app which is defined as com.sweetwilliam.hmipad.hmipad, so the app is no longer able to open files of any other type than its own declared document type.\
\
This app was first reviewed one month ago. Over this time we made changes to the app to get it better for approval and made several resubmissions during this period.\
\
Before the previous submission I had the chance to speak with Steve Rea to whom I discussed on what was needed to be done on the app to get it better for approval. We agreed upon several changes that needed to be performed which I made. These changes were already there on the version you just rejected, so I am puzzled on what the issue is now.\
\
I decided to submit the app again with the removal of the "Content Files" document types as described above hopping that this is the remaining change that will finally get the app to the store. I can not think on anything else that could lead the app to be rejected now.\
\
I want to mention that we have been working very hard and for a very long time to develop this app, this is not by far an app that has been cobbled together on a few days or even weeks. It took almost one year to be completed and we have big expectations that it will be a big hit among its target audience. \
\
This app will become a reference in the HMI industry. It is not possible to remove yet more features without completely killing the app, or converting the app in just a mediocre product. We do not want such a thing, and Apple should consider the same. This app will surely bring Apple iPad sales to people who otherwise would not have a particular preference. This is already happening with the few apps that I distributed for testing through ad-hoc. People did already buy iPads just to run this app. The app will bring additional income to Apple through the in-app purchase options in the app.\
\
So I would really appreciate that you take a couple of minutes to consider all the above into consideration and get the app approved as soon as possible. I am asking for an expedited review because we can not wait any longer.\
\
Thank you very much.\

Dear Sirs,\
\
I write to you to ask for help or suggestions following a rejection of our app "HMI Draw".\
\
The app "HMI Draw" has been rejected for non compliance with guideline 2.7: "apps that download code in any way or form will be rejected".\'a0\
\
The app is a fairly complex Document based app featuring elaborated ways to interact with objects on pages. It does not download external code but both the App Review Team and the App Review Board considered otherwise. I believe they did not quite understand the app. So I am faced now with the problem of having to remove or change functionality from the app, which is why I need some help.\'a0Technically, the application model of this app is a tree like graph of objects. A document file is created by recursively traversing the application model and serializing it into a file in the usual way. Conversely, document files are converted back to the application model in memory by performing the reverse operation.\
\
The HMI Draw app is similar to Keynote or Pages in the sense that it allows users to place objects on pages such as images or other visual elements for example several kinds of indicators and controls like bars, trends, sliders and so on. The app has also the ability to communicate with industrial devices called PLCs and to get discrete engineering data such as temperatures, pressures, weights and other data values that particular PLCs may manage. The app also allows visual elements on pages to be linked to PLCs to present values on a graphical manner, or to use controls placed by users on pages to write discrete data to PLCs. Users can link visual elements in pages with PLC values by using mathematical relationships (formulas) in a similar way than they would link cells on a spreadsheet program.\
\
The purpose of the app is therefore to create dynamic graphical representations of real time engineering data. Users create the so called HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces) to monitor industrial PLC values.\
\
On a previous submission the app featured an embedded web server. The purpose of it was to provide a means to import and export files from the app including its own documents and image files in a way that was straightforward for users. This was rejected alleging this was meant to download code. On the last rejection I am asked to remove iTunes File sharing from the app for the same reason, thus leaving the app with no other direct options to import or export files.\
\
The target users for this app are Industrial Automation Integrators that create said HMIs in the app. Industrial Automation Integrators keep their documents and image files organized in folders in their own PC and they usually create document templates as a starting point for new documents. Not only users expect this app to have the ability to export and import documents, but there are many other good reasons for having this feature. Removing the ability to move documents in and out greatly jeopardizes the app. This like only allowing Keynote to run as a closed system.\
\
The first question I have for you is what "downloading code" actually means. We have been using an Embedded Web Server and iTunes File Sharing in ALL our apps. On all them, documents are plain text files describing the object properties of the application model. We are not using NSKeyedUnarchiver because we found it too slow for very big documents but a custom NSCoder subclass. To my understanding this is perfectly legit because this possibility is documented.\
\
I think one concern of the reviewers could be that users can use formulas to define links among objects. Same as an spreadsheet program. However, ALL of our apps and some we made for particular customers feature the same. All of them have been consistently approved during years. Formulas in our apps are just that, they are not a programming language or anything like that, just functions and operators applied to values that are specified as text. I have been able to identify a couple of other document based apps in the app store which also implement formulas, but there must be many more. I don't think this should the cause for rejection either. So, I am lost on why we got rejected. \
\
Another question I have for you is which are the available means for importing/exporting files that will not be considered by the review team to break guideline 2.7 for this (or any) app. In particular I need to know whether there is a different consideration for importing files using services on the cloud such as Dropbox or others, as opposed to directly importing them from a computer by for example using iTunes File Sharing.\
\
I would also appreciate detailed advise on what would be allowed and how do I make the review team understand that the app is indeed compliant with guideline 2.7.\'a0\
\
I fully understand you are not part of the review team but I am asking this to you because the last person I talked with from the App Review Board instructed me to do so. She specifically told me to contact Apple Developer Technical Support to ask for ways to import files onto this app. Essentially, I wonder if your previous experience on this kind of rejection could bring some light to me on what can be done or what can not be done for importing files into the app. For as much as possible I want to avoid further trial and error cycles with the submission and review process of this app because this only serves to waste time and money for both of us. I wish you can help me in some way.\
\
I have an additional (less important) question. For importing images, I understand it is possible to implement a view controller to select multiple images from the photo library. However I wonder if it is possible to recover the original file names of images. Let's suppose an user has several images in her PC named "Boiler.png", "Valve.png" and "RedLed.png" and so on. These images can be moved to the iPad by using iTunes and retrieved from the app through the ALAssetsLibrary, but I can't manage to get the original names of the images. I tried [[asset defaultRepresentation] fileName] but all I get are names like "IMG_0016.jpg", These kind of names are not useful for users because the app needs to identify particular images that are associated to objects by its name, as this can change dynamically in the app. Is there a procedure to get the original file names?\
\
Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this matter.\
\
Best Regards,\
"\
\
\
==== 3 Agost 2013 TENTATIU NO ENVIAT =====\
\
Dear Mr. Rea,\
\
The "HMI Draw" app is still being rejected for non compliance of 2.7\
\
To begin with, this is plain wrong. I insist, the app is a document based app and its documents do not contain code.\
\
I have removed the integrated file server as this was considered a mechanism to import code. I removed iTunes File Sharing for the same reason. I limited the app document types to just its own declared UTI type. And I improved image import from iPhoto to compensate for the latter. But still, App Review keeps rejecting the app. This is a mistake and totally unfair.\
\
The app is being treated as actually importing external code, but it does not. This app is not designed to do so. You would understand that we would not have spend a whole year working very hard and putting money on a project if we had thought that it *could* break guideline 2.7. This would be nonsense. \
\
For some reason the believing that the app downloads code has been installed in the App Review Team and we can't get past it. I doubt the app has been looked at properly, specially recently because I know there has been no activity on the server during review. It just seems to me that the app has been rejected right away after the latest submissions. I wonder if the reviewer have ever tried to create a document in the app to understand what the app is and what it does. At the least, I can describe this as frustrating for me.\
\
The "HMI Draw" app is unique in its field. I do not get why Apple would not want to have it on the store, or cooperate with me on a fairer basis. This is the first true native HMI product available for the iOS platform. Others may spend years to catch us if they ever do, and the right momentum is now here for us. Maybe there are no native HMI apps on the store because all of them have been rejected before ours, but frankly, I do not think this could be the case.\
\
Honestly, approving this app is just a matter of looking at it and understanding it. I insist, the app does not download code. I wish Apple explained me why they think this app downloads code or what you understand by code.\
 \
Last time we talked over the phone you recommended me to appeal the app review board. You know I did, but the person I talked with was not an Engineer. She was kind and polite but she just repeated some instructed words to the effect of this: "you must remove iTunes File Sharing before resubmitting the app because your app uses it to download code. You can ask for technical assistance though Apple Technical Support about how to do so". Sure, this procedure is effective when applied to poorly designed apps made by unexperienced developers who may even need some moral guidance, but neither the "HMI Draw" app or ourselves fail into this category. \
\
I believe we do not deserve this treatment because we are active Apple advocates, helped Apple in several occasions to solve difficult bugs in the iOS SDK, and we exclusively develop for the Apple Platform. Some bits of our past contributions are present on Apple products, ok, they may be small, but we feel proud of having helped.\
\
You need to recognize that the standard procedure may not be right or fair on all cases. Particularly because I can not quite defend my case unless I am allowed to discuss the technical aspects of the app with somebody who actually has spend some time with it, or better yet to a high level executive that could really evaluate my arguments.\
\

\cf0 I am not going to mention a lot of third party apps because I could find hundreds, but I do want you to consider the following apps WE developed, all of them are on the app store: ScadaMobile (id: 324515280), Mobile Mirror Free (id: 356591095), Mobile Mirror (id: 356604427), ProSoft i-View (id: 385920646), ProSoft i-View Lite (id: 397352772),  iBoat (id: 409680688), ScadaMobile ONE (id:411275815),  Modbus Gem (id:442983985), AndOnMobile (id: 513279154), HMI View (id: 662858917).\
\
MOST of them incorporate an embedded Web Server.\
MOST of them use iTunes File sharing to import files.\
MOST of them incorporate ways to import files from remote servers.\
ALL of them incorporate the Audio Background Mode.\
ALL of them import document files that are plain text files.\
ALL of them allow users to link objects by using mathematical relationships in a similar way than a spreadsheet program.\
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 ALL of them share the same code base for communications with PLCs, for importing files, and for executing links.\
MOST of them have been on the app store for more than 3 years.\
The "HMI View" app has been approved just a few weeks ago.\
\
Yet NONE of them do violate 2.7 but the "HMI Draw" does (?). There is something wrong here. You should look at ALL our apps with the SAME criteria and approve the "HMI Draw" app right away with all its initial features. Or if you have been wrong for years you have now the opportunity to reject everything and kill us as a company, which would be lamentable.\
\
You need to listen, be coherent and stop all this nonsense. The review team is clearly committing a mistake unless you allow me to explain, or they explain me what PARTICULARLY makes the "HMI Draw" to break 2.7 while OUR other apps do not.\
\
I also want to put my focus on an application on the app store named "iSpreadSheet" (id: 306226132) from a developer named Savy Soda that shares some relevant features with "HMI Draw". (I could also mention "Numbers" from Apple, for which the same would apply). The iSpreadSheet app is not a particularly 'beautiful' or extraordinary app but the app features the following:\
\
- It is a SpreadSheet program, so cells are linked together using formulas.\
- It Supports ITunes File sharing.\
- It Includes an embedded web server.\
\
In this sense the "HMI Draw" app is just a more elaborate version of iSpreadSheet. Instead of 'cells' we have objects on screen that display values graphically. There is conceptually no other difference. The above is allowed for them, so why is it not for us?\
\
I appreciate the conversation I had with you because you are the only person al Apple so far who actually spend some of his time to discuss with me regarding this subject. You also offered helping me eventually.\
\
I just want your help on putting me in contact with the right person to whom I could discuss my case appropriately -both from a technical point of view or eventually politically-, and the one who would be able to execute decisions at a higher level in case this is not you.\
\
Please, just give me the *real* opportunity to work with Apple to jointly define the technical aspects of this app in a way that would suit both of us, and stop all this nonsense. I am a very reasonable and treatable person, just my spoken English is not totally fluent, but I assume this can be overcome. I really am willing to cooperate. I mean really. But you must do too\
\
Thank you very much.\

\cf0 "\
Dear Sirs,\
\
I write to you to ask for help or suggestions following a former rejection of our app "HMI Draw".\
\
The app "HMI Draw" was rejected in August for non compliance with guideline 2.7: "apps that download code in any way or form will be rejected".\'a0\
\
The app is a fairly complex Document based app featuring elaborated ways to interact with objects on pages. It does not download external code. I believe the App Review Team and the App Review Board did not understand the app. After a lot of pain and many cycles of emails and conversations the app was eventually accepted, but I had to remove some functionality on the app. The functionality that had to be removed was and an Embedded Web Server and iTunes File Sharing.\
\
Technically, the application model of this app is a tree like graph of objects. A document is created by recursively traversing the application model and serializing it into a file in the usual way. Conversely, document files are converted back to the application model in memory by performing the reverse operation.\
\

Removing the ability to move documents in and out greatly jeopardizes the app. This like allowing Keynote to run only as a closed system.\

ALL of them are able to import/export other files such as images, or pdf documents.\
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 ALL of them have been on the app store for more than 3 years.\
\
The first question I have for you is what "downloading code" actually means. As said, we have been using an Embedded Web Server and iTunes File Sharing in ALL our apps, and there are some other apps on the app store that implement it as well. The HMI Draw app is no different on what it would do with it.\
\
Another question I have for you is which are the available means for importing/exporting files that will not be considered by the review team to break guideline 2.7 for this (or any) app. In particular I need to know whether there is a different consideration for importing files using services in the cloud, as opposed to doing so by for example using iTunes File Sharing. This question comes from the fact that the HMI Draw app is indeed allowed to import/export documents using external servers or email attachments, but it is not allowed to do so using iTunes File sharing or the embedded web server.\
\
I would also appreciate detailed advise on what would be allowed and how do I make the review team understand that the app will be still compliant with guideline 2.7 after we add the embedded web server and iTunes File Sharing.\
\
My users are used to the mentioned importing/exporting options because these options are available on our other apps. Users ask me why these options are not available on the HMI Draw app, and why importing/exporting on the HMI Draw app can not be as straightforward as it is on my other apps.\
\
I would like to resubmit the app with said features without being rejected again, so I seek your help on this. \
\
Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this matter.\
\
Yours Sincerely,\
\
John Lluch-Zorrilla.\

Dear Sirs,\
\
The App HMI Draw has been rejected for non compliance with guideline 2.7: "apps that download code in any way or form will be rejected". \
\
Before submitting the app for review I asked for help to the Developer Technical Support. In their answer they mentioned they had escalated my inquiry to the App Store Review Team with reference Follow-up #300708026. I copy below my query to Developer Technical Support and their answer for your records:\
\
\
** My query to Developer Technical Support: **\
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 \
"\
Dear Sirs,\
\
I write to you to ask for help or suggestions following a former rejection of our app "HMI Draw".\
\
The app "HMI Draw" was rejected in August for non compliance with guideline 2.7: "apps that download code in any way or form will be rejected".\'a0\
\
The app is a fairly complex Document based app featuring elaborated ways to interact with objects on pages. It does not download external code. I believe the App Review Team and the App Review Board did not understand the app. After a lot of pain and many cycles of emails and conversations the app was eventually accepted, but I had to remove some functionality on the app. The functionality that had to be removed was and an Embedded Web Server and iTunes File Sharing.\
\
Technically, the application model of this app is a tree like graph of objects. A document is created by recursively traversing the application model and serializing it into a file in the usual way. Conversely, document files are converted back to the application model in memory by performing the reverse operation.\
\
The HMI Draw app is similar to Keynote or Pages in the sense that it allows users to place objects on pages such as images or other visual elements for example several kinds of indicators and controls like bars, trends, sliders and so on. The app has also the ability to communicate with industrial devices called PLCs and to get discrete engineering data such as temperatures, pressures, weights and other data values that particular PLCs may manage. The app also allows visual elements on pages to be linked to PLCs to present values on a graphical manner, or to use controls placed by users on pages to write discrete data to PLCs. \
\
The purpose of the app is therefore to create dynamic graphical representations of real time engineering data. Users create the so called HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces) to monitor industrial PLC values.\
\
On the initial submission -the one that was rejected- the app featured an embedded web server. The purpose of it was to provide a means to import and export files from the app including its own documents and image files in a way that was easy for users. This was rejected alleging that this was meant to download code. On the last rejection I was also asked to remove iTunes File sharing from the app for the same reason, thus leaving the app with no other direct options to import or export files.\
\
The target users for this app are Industrial Automation Integrators that create said HMIs in the app. Industrial Automation Integrators keep their documents and image files organized in folders in their own PC and they usually create document templates as a starting point for new documents. Not only users expect this app to have the ability to export and import documents, but there are many other good reasons for allowing this. Removing the ability to move documents in and out greatly jeopardizes the app. This like allowing Keynote to run only as a closed system.\

\cf0 \
Eventually I received the following message from App Review\
\
"\
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 Hello Joan,\
\
Thank you for contacting us. We have forwarded your feedback to the appropriate team. Someone from this team will investigate and follow up as needed. Because we can only share communications about an app with its developer, you will not receive updates in this matter.\
\
In regards to your app, HMI Draw, I see that it is currently in the Waiting For Review status. After the review has been completed, you will receive an email notifying you of the change of state. If we find we need additional information to complete the review, we will contact you directly\
\
If the Review team identifies any issues that you believe does not accurately reflect your app and its compliance with the App Review Guidelines, you are always welcome to request an appeal by completing the "Submit a Rejection Appeal" form: \
\
\pard\pardeftab720
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://developer.apple.com/appstore/contact/appreviewboard/index.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf7 \ul \ulc7 http://developer.apple.com/appstore/contact/appreviewboard/index.html}}\
\
After the App Review Board receives your request, they will investigate your appeal based on the details provided. When a decision has been reached, you will be notified of the outcome.\
\
Best Regards,\

\
That was a rather generic answer asking me to resubmit the app, so I just followed your recommendation and I submitted the app again, but the app was rejected.\
\
This rejection is wrong. Please make some high level person to contact me directly so I am given the opportunity to demonstrate it. Honestly, approving this app is just a matter of looking at it and understanding it as it does NOT download code, nor it is designed to do so.\
\
Thanks.\
